Helga is already working on a shrine. Top Story Getty Images To the Moon and Back The Story NASA\u2019s Artemis I mission is set to take off . Let the countdown begin. For the first time in nearly 50 years, NASA is launching a mission to the moon \u2014 using its most powerful rocket ever. There won\u2019t be any astronauts on board. But today\u2019s launch is a crucial test that marks the start of NASA\u2019s eagerly awaited new lunar program. Now \u2014 specifically, at 8:33 am ET \u2014 it\u2019s time for blast off. (Here\u2019s how to watch .) Mission details, Houston. The mission\u2019s spacecraft will travel more than 1.3 million miles around the moon over the course of 42 days. But ultimately this is all about preparing to bring humans back to the moon as soon as 2025...for the first time since 1972. NASA hopes to reach the moon\u2019s unexplored south pole, where there might be ice in craters to support future crews. And it hopes to lay the groundwork for future missions to Mars by using the moon\u2019s surface for training and testing. theSkimm NASA\u2019s return to the moon has been decades in the making and cost billions to fund. Now it\u2019s time to see whether the long-awaited program will give us the moon, or if expectations will have to come back to Earth. And Also...This What\u2019s got us trying to read in between the lines\u2026 The Mar-a-Lago affidavit . On Friday, the Department of Justice released a heavily redacted 32-page affidavit. It\u2019s the document the FBI used to get a warrant to search former President Donald Trump\u2019s home in August. The affidavit confirms that secret documents were recovered from Mar-a-Lago earlier in the year. Reminder: back in January, Trump\u2019s team returned 15 boxes of government documents to the National Archives after taking them home from the White House. The affidavit says those included 184 documents labeled as \u201csecret,\u201d \u201cconfidential,\u201c or \u201ctop secret.\u201d And contained info about \u201cclandestine human sources\u201c (think: spies or informants) that could have been dangerous in the wrong hands. Fast forward to August: the FBI went back to Trump\u2019s residence with their warrant,\u00a0and found 11 additional sets of classified documents. The DOJ hasn\u2019t commented beyond the release of the affidavit, but in June it said the documents hadn\u2019t been \u201chandled in an appropriate manner.\u201c Trump\u2019s spokesperson says that there was no reason for a search and that it\u2019s \u201call politics.\u201d Who\u2019s saying \u2018I did it first\u2019\u2026 Moderna . Last week, the Massachusetts-based company sued Pfizer and the German drugmaker BioNTech for patent infringement. Moderna says that Pfizer and BioNTech hit copy and paste on its mRNA tech for their COVID-19 vaccine. Moderna claims it filed the patents way back between 2010 and 2016. The company pledged not to enforce its patent when the pandemic was in full force. And it says it isn\u2019t trying to get Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines off the market now. But it wants companies to respect its intellectual property and request proper permission to use its work. Both Pfizer and BioNTech responded that their work is original, and say they\u2019ll defend themselves in court. \u2026Oh and speaking of vaccines, the Biden admin is expected to have Omicron-specific boosters ready around the week after Labor Day. What\u2019s got parents talking\u2026 Missouri . This summer, Cassville R-IV School District in western MO gave the \u2018OK\u2019 to bring back spanking. The district told parents that it would start swatting students with paddles as a punishment for misbehavior. Kids would only be spanked if their parents give written permission \u2014 with a choice to opt out later. The district also claims it will only swat kids as a last resort and that it will not be done in front of their peers. Other rules: two workers must be present (the spanker and a witness) and they cannot hit students in the head or face. The measure is a school board response to a survey sent to parents, students, and staff, which found that parents were worried about student behavior. Many states have outlawed corporal punishment in schools \u2014 but Missouri is one of 19 that still allow it. Who\u2019s GOAT us in our feels\u2026 Serena Williams .
